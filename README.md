# Power-BI-Dashboard
Here i have used dummy data of UK Road Accidents and compared the percentage of current year vs previous year to get some insights from the data.
And i have focused on few business questions which i mentioned below:
1) Determined the total casualties and total accident values for current year and YoY growth.
2) Total casualties by accident severity for current year and YoY growth.
3) Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.
4) Monthly trend showing comparison of casualities for current and previous year.
5) Casualities by road type for current year.
6) Casualities by weather conditions and day/night.
7) Total casualities and total accidents by locations.

This business question are answered in those dashboard and those answers helpful to reduce the accidents or taken care by transport department.
